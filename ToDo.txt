[X] Fixed-Timestep Updates for Client and Server


[x] Client sends server updates.
 	[x] How to reflect changes in client state that occur between updates?
		- SOLUTION: For movement, just rely on fixed upates and interpolation.
	[ ] How to reflect actions that might need to happen multiple times per a fixed update?


[X] Server sends client update game state. Client copies game state


[ ] Client side interpolation


[ ] Client Reconciliation when prediction differs significantly from client state



NOTE: This feature is useful for rollback, but not the most important feature to be implementing
[x] Implement a circular buffer on the client, for Client state, and received server state
	[ ] Modify client's reading of packets and server's writing of packets to include the state sequence number
	[ ] Make sure stateSequenceId's cannot exceed maximum number of states. implement circular system
	[ ] Using the rate of state creation, decide on a value for MAX_STATES




---------- Low Priority Tasks ----------
[ ] Move the fixed update period to the dll.

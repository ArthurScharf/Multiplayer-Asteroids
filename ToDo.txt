`clients` in Server aren't having their controlled actors being correctly assigned. They're NULL










----------  KEY ---------- 
[ ] : Task. Will definitely be included in the project

( ) : Morphing task. Usually something to understand so an actual task can replace this one

--------------------------





[X] 1. Program state management				
	- Moving between game states effectively
	- clearly defined states

[X] 2. Retrieving the timestep from the server


[X] 3. Remote Procedure calls
	- Double check that old passed calls are being removed properly
	- Consider making approach to storing and removing calls more efficient


[X] 4. move Spawning to be an RPC
	- Should client also receive spawn RPC? (Probably not. What we have works well enough rn)

[ ] 5. Proper proxy handling
	- Is the proxy positioned correctly? I recall the proxy being in the wrong location once the client was being handled
	- Destroying the proxy when the client receives proper replication


[ ] 6. State comparison & Reconciliation









---------- Proxy Network Ownership ----------

1. Clients should be properly assigned network IDs upon connection	X
	- Server should maintain pool		X
	- Disconnection isn't handled at the moment. We can worry about this later
	- Clients need to be findable based on their ipaddress. We shouldn't be creating a new client object each time we receive a message


2. Actor ID's shouldn't allow for accidentally overwriting bits reserved for network ownership During Spawn
	- network ID assignments to actors is done in the server and client. Server and client should both have a way of handling this
	  > A subroutine in both server and client to guarantee that this never happens, is probably best

3. Server should assign network ownership bits when a client connects

4. Server must create controlled player character actor using an ID that is compliant with the design
	- Client now sets nextPredictedOwnedActorNetworkID to controlledActorID + 1 once connection is established
	- 



_. Clients should predict network ID when constructing proxies
_. Clients should destroy proxies when receiving the true actor data









[ ] Modify program to make proper use of Client struct, rather than associating information together using a map



[ ] BUG: If somehow the reply to spawn messages reaches our client AFTER the spawned actor is replicated, we'll have problems



[ ] BUG: Spawning actors from the server is failing to remove the proxies once their server copy has begun to be replicated


[ ] Server proxy spawns aren't being done on the correct frame. They're being done instantly


[ ] Find a better solution for controlling the state of the program. Problematic bug when looping to get servers current state sequence ID

[ ] Server is still sending snapshots as a list of actors instead of a list of actorNetData's. This should be changed

[ ] Properly compare for state's being received from server and decide on reconciliation method

[ ] Spawned client side proxies need to not use actor ID's that conflict with those used by proper actors within the system.

[1/2] Client stores it's own snapshots and compares to the ones received from server when they're received
	[ ] Client Creates and stores GameStates
	[ ] Client properly unpacks Gamestates from server
	[ ] Greater Consideration must be placed into what constitutes a bad comparison between states

[ ] Client Reconciliation

[ ] Handling Actions that will often occur several times between fixed updates

[ ] Handle case where stateSequenceID's could exceed maximum value. ie. we need to wrap




NOTE: This feature is useful for rollback, but not the most important feature to be implementing
[x] Implement a circular buffer on the client, for Client state, and received server state
	[ ] Modify client's reading of packets and server's writing of packets to include the state sequence number
	[ ] Make sure stateSequenceId's cannot exceed maximum number of states. implement circular system
	[ ] Using the rate of state creation, decide on a value for MAX_STATES










-------------------------------------
---------- Spawning Actors ----------
------------------------------------- 

[x] Pre-load and cache all the meshes needed for creating actors so this isn't done when actors are spawned
	[x] Implement a static method in Actor that caches the meshes at runtime
	[ ] fix bug that is preventing the loading from being done as the first step in the client's main function	

[ ] Handle responsive client side predicted spawning of actors
	[ ] Spawning ghost actor on client side & sending spawn request. Frame data must be included in request so server knows which frame is 
	    the spawn frame.
	[ ] Ghost actor must able to be associated with network id if server proxy is successfully spawned





----------------------------------------
---------- Low Priority Tasks ----------
----------------------------------------

[ ] Move the fixed update period to the dll.


NOTE: The game is for LAN. At the moment, simply sending each state seems to work. We'll fry other fish first
[ ] Design Reconciliation approach for locally generated client states differ from those predicted by the server

( ) Do we need to remove the buffer consuming loop? Fixed-Updates might solve this issue

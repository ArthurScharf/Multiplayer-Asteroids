Client 
 - Must be able to continue to receive updates even when it's character is dead



Client doesn't need to receive an entire actor back after requesting actor data. It only needs to know it's character's


Server loop updates replicated data from each client back to all other clients.
--> Each client just needs to know if it's controlling a player

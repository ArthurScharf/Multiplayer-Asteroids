RPC's Require
 - Simulation Step it's called in
 - seconds since last update, so procedure call is made at the right moment. While both client and server update at a fixed frequency,
   the server and client also simulate frame by frame for different reasons.
   Server does so to maintain simulation accuracy, and client does so to be as responsive as possible for the player
 - Data to call RPC




How do I track which RPC's are to be called?
	- Server/Client tells container which simulation step is being ran
	- container handles callbacks


	How do I store callbacks?
		- What if method to be called back is private? can't be done.
			Can I make all callbacks public? 
				Yes. Having a public communication point is the same as being public. 
		- I can store callbacks as function pointers

	How do I make the callbacks at the correct time?

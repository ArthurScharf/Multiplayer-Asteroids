How do I write an output logger? I'm sick of rerunning the 
program. 





----------  KEY ---------- 
[ ] : Task. Will definitely be included in the project

( ) : Morphing task. Usually something to understand so an actual task can replace this one

--------------------------




Starting Point: Client receives a state and simply sets it's state to that state.



[ ] Rework movement so loop of main on client is processed as a desired input bit string
	[x] Create the appropriate input struct for the client to update the server with
	[x] create bitmasks for different user inputs
	
[ ] Store these bitstrings on the server and batch process them. Reply with correct state.
    This reply should include ACK for most recent handled request.
    At this point, the client can simply apply the most recently processed state to it's current position

[ ] Client should store its requests and ack them using incoming updates

OpenGL Rendering
 - GLFW (OpenGL implementation)
 - GLAD (OpenGL function definitions)
 - GLM  (OpenGL Math)
 - Assimp (Loading FBX Files for models)

WinSock for networking
 - Chat Feature
 - Replication
    - The server sends instructions to clients to spawn asteroids
    - The clients send their instructions to the server for character movement
    - The server implements player instructions, progresses asteroids and projectiles, then replicates
      these values back to the client.
    - Client side movement prediction (Stretch goal)

Collision Detection Solution
 - Each frame all objects are hashed into a 2d hashmap O(n)
 - Hash function --> object.xy coordinates rounded to closest value of R
 - R = Largest possible radial distance possible without collision
	- R = Player ship radius size + Asteroid size
 - Once objects are hashed, we check adjacent squares to each ship location. If asteroid occupies current ship square,
   OR occupies square adjacent to ship square, we calculate distance. If distance has collision, we collide
 - This algorithm is repeated for projectiles on the screen, comparing to asteroids for collision

Animation Solution
 - Asteroids will rotate around a random axis for their duration.
 - Ships will rotate so long as a turn key is held by a player
 - Ships will interp a ROLL to a max value while turning. (Stretch goal)

Menu Solution
 - We're going to avoid this for now. The server will only begin play when two players are connected.
   Once a player's connection is established, they see the game with only their ship. Once both player's have
   connected, we can begin having them move around





---------- Feature Order ----------
0. Figure out how to get the chat room working over the LAN
1. Build the server to be able to receive client connection and to replicate a vector back to the client
2. Build the rendering pipeline for the client. Have the pipeline replicate movement
3. Predictive movement for player ships. Asteroids lifespans and collision are server authority, but each client instances
   are handled by the client with respect to movement and animation
4. Extend replication to include gameplay features like asteroids, projectiles, and so on





---------- Code Design ----------
Since OpenGL is built to create a window and to handle input, OpenGL's input processing will be our program's
entrypoint for processing input

Question: How do I handle the difference between the frequency at which the server is replicating data, 
          and the processing speed of each computer? Obviously deltaTime handles the difference between processing speed,
          but what about the rate at which data is replicated?
Answer: This is what ping is. Games handle ping problems by removing players with terrible ping from games,
        so they don't ruin the experience of other players

game loop
 1. Collision
 2. Rendering


The server address is assigned in the code. Therefore, the client will always know where to connect to
